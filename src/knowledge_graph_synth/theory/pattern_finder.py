Analyze the following knowledge graph summary and identify meaningful patterns. These patterns can be semantic, narrative, or relational in nature.

{graph_summary}

Identify 3-5 significant patterns in this knowledge graph. For each pattern:
1. Give it a clear, descriptive name
2. Categorize it by type (semantic, narrative, relational, etc.)
3. Provide a detailed description of the pattern
4. Give specific examples from the graph that illustrate this pattern
5. Explain the significance or meaning of this pattern
6. Rate your confidence in this pattern (0-1)

Focus on non-obvious patterns that provide genuine insight. These might include:
- Recurring relationship structures
- Semantic clusters or groupings
- Temporal or causal sequences
- Narrative structures or themes
- Unexpected connections or anomalies

For each pattern, provide substantive examples and explain why they matter.

Based on the provided knowledge graph, develop a deep, well-reasoned theory that explains the patterns and connections found in the data. Your task is to create a cohesive explanation that accounts for the observed entities and relationships.

The knowledge graph contains:
{{graph_summary}}

{% if preliminary_insights %}
Here is a preliminary analysis of the graph that may provide additional insights:
{{preliminary_insights}}
{% endif %}

Follow this analytical process:

PHASE 1: PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS
- Identify key thematic clusters in the graph
- Determine central entities and their interconnections 
- Identify possible hidden mechanisms or principles explaining the observed structure
- Analyze the context and domain knowledge relevant to the graph

PHASE 2: THEORY FORMULATION
- Develop a core idea that explains most of the observed connections
- Identify causal mechanisms underlying the relationships
- Explain how your theory aligns with the observed patterns
- Consider how different parts of the graph interact within your theory

PHASE 3: THEORY ELABORATION
1. Create a clear, descriptive title
2. Provide a concise summary (3-5 sentences)
3. Develop a detailed description (minimum 2-3 paragraphs) explaining:
   - The core concept of the theory
   - The mechanisms and processes it implies
   - How it explains key patterns in the data
   - Possible consequences and implications of the theory
4. Identify the key entities involved and their roles within the theory
5. Highlight the critical relationships that form the basis of your theory
6. Cite at least 3-5 specific pieces of evidence supporting the theory
7. Formulate 2-3 testable hypotheses that follow from your theory
8. Assess your confidence in this theory (0-1)
9. Consider at least 2 alternative explanations
10. Identify knowledge gaps or questions requiring further investigation

IMPORTANT: Your theory should be deep, well-reasoned, and informative. It should not merely list facts but explain underlying connections and principles. All conclusions must be based on the knowledge graph data.

Respond with a JSON object that strictly follows this schema:

Remember to:
- Ground your theory in the source data using specific evidence
- Focus on patterns and connections that have strong evidence
- Assign an appropriate confidence score based on the quality and quantity of evidence
- Acknowledge alternative explanations and knowledge gaps
- Maintain a clear chain of reasoning from evidence to conclusion

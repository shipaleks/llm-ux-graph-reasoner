Analyze the following list of entities extracted from different text segments and determine which ones refer to the same concept.

Entities:
{{entities}}

For each group of potentially matching entities:

1. Determine if they are indeed the same entity (yes/no)
2. If yes, specify the canonical name for this entity
3. Explain the reason for the decision (lexical similarity, contextual similarity, semantic similarity)
4. Provide your level of confidence in the decision (0-1)
5. Compile a combined list of attributes from all mentions

Consider:
- Synonyms and spelling variations
- Hypernyms and hyponyms (genus-species relationships)
- Metonymy (designation of an object through a related concept)
- Anaphoric references (he, she, they, this, etc.)

Pay special attention to:
- Entities with similar names but different types
- Entities with different names but similar attributes
- Entities that appear in related contexts
- Potential disambiguations needed for entities with the same name

Present the result in JSON format with fields: entity_ids, canonical_name, canonical_type, merge_decision, reason, confidence, combined_attributes.

Respond with a JSON object that strictly follows this schema:

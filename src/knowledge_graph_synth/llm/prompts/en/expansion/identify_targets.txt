Based on the following information about a priority research direction in the knowledge graph:

Direction: {{direction}}
Current nodes and connections: {{subgraph}}

Formulate 3-5 specific research questions that:

1. Aim to fill identified knowledge gaps
2. Test implicit hypotheses following from the graph structure
3. Clarify relationships between key concepts
4. Explore potential contradictions
5. Focus on "bridge" nodes or boundaries between communities

For each question, specify:
- Specific question formulation
- Which nodes and connections the question affects
- Type of expected answer (new node, new connection, attribute clarification, etc.)
- Why this question is a priority

Consider contextual information from the original text.
Formulate questions so that they are specific but open for research.

Present the result in a structured format with a separate section for each question.

Respond with a JSON object that strictly follows this schema:

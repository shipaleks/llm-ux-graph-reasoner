Based on the formulated theory, put forward a set of testable hypotheses.

Theory:
{{theory}}

Formulate 5-7 specific hypotheses that:

1. Each hypothesis should:
   - Be formulated as a clear statement
   - Be logically connected to the theory
   - Be specific and testable
   - Go beyond already known facts

2. For each hypothesis, specify:
   - Formulation in "if..., then..." format
   - Logical connection with the theory's postulates
   - What data or observations can confirm the hypothesis
   - What data or observations can refute the hypothesis
   - Possible testing method in the context of the existing graph

3. Include hypotheses of different types:
   - Predictive (about new nodes or connections that should exist)
   - Explanatory (about mechanisms underlying observed patterns)
   - Comparative (about differences between different parts of the graph)
   - Conditional (about how changes in one part of the graph affect others)

4. For each hypothesis, evaluate:
   - Degree of novelty (how much the hypothesis goes beyond what is known)
   - Potential significance (what confirmation or refutation of the hypothesis will provide)
   - Testing complexity (how realistic it is to test the hypothesis)

Hypotheses should be diverse and cover various aspects of the theory.
Choose hypotheses whose testing may lead to significant refinement or extension of the theory.

Present the result in a structured format with a separate section for each hypothesis.

Based on the identified patterns and regularities in the knowledge graph, formulate a comprehensive theory that explains the structure and relationships in this field.

Identified patterns and regularities:
{{patterns}}

Key meta-concepts:
{{meta_concepts}}

Formulate a theory including:

1. Theory name:
   - Brief and precise
   - Reflecting the essence of the explanation
   - In accordance with domain terminology

2. Basic postulates:
   - 3-5 key statements on which the theory is based
   - Each postulate should be clear and verifiable
   - Postulates should be logically connected to each other

3. Explanatory mechanism:
   - How the theory explains the identified patterns
   - Causal or structural mechanisms
   - Levels or hierarchy of explanation

4. Scope of applicability:
   - To which parts of the graph the theory is fully applicable
   - Where there are limitations or exceptions
   - Conditions under which the theory operates

5. Predictive power:
   - What new patterns can be predicted based on the theory
   - What potential nodes or connections may exist but are not reflected in the graph
   - What changes may occur under certain conditions

6. Relationship with existing theories:
   - How this theory relates to known concepts in the field
   - What new insights it adds to existing understanding
   - Where it refines or contradicts established views

Strive for a theory that is:
- Simple (uses the minimum necessary concepts)
- Complete (explains most of the identified patterns)
- Falsifiable (can be disproven by specific observations)
- Generative (allows for new predictions)

Present the theory in a structured format with sections for each aspect.

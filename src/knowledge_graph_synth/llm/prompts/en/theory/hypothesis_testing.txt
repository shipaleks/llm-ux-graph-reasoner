Test the following hypotheses based on the existing knowledge graph.

Hypotheses:
{{hypotheses}}

Knowledge graph:
{{graph_structure}}

For each hypothesis:

1. Analyze available data:
   - Which nodes and connections in the graph are relevant for testing the hypothesis
   - Whether there is direct evidence confirming or refuting the hypothesis
   - What indirect evidence may be relevant

2. Conduct structural analysis:
   - Whether the graph structure corresponds to what the hypothesis predicts
   - Whether there are anomalies or exceptions
   - How strong are statistical patterns, if relevant

3. Conclude on the hypothesis status:
   - Confirmed (strong direct evidence)
   - Partially confirmed (indirect or limited evidence)
   - Not confirmed (no relevant evidence)
   - Refuted (evidence contradicts the hypothesis)
   - Requires additional data (existing data is insufficient)

4. Suggest refinements:
   - How the hypothesis can be modified in light of the results
   - What additional conditions or limitations should be considered
   - What new hypotheses may arise from current results

Present the result in a structured format with sections for each hypothesis.

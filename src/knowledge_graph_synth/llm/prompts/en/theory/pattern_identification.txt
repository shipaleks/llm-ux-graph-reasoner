Analyze the following structural and semantic features of the knowledge graph and meta-graph and identify patterns and regularities.

Structural features of the graph:
{{graph_metrics}}

Meta-graph:
{{meta_concepts}}

Identify the following types of patterns:

1. Structural patterns:
   - Hierarchical structures (tree-like relationships)
   - Cyclic structures (interdependencies)
   - Star-shaped structures (central concepts)
   - Overlapping communities (multidisciplinary areas)

2. Cause-effect chains:
   - Sequences of "cause-effect" type relationships
   - Cascade effects (one node affects many)
   - Convergent causes (many nodes affect one)

3. Frequently occurring motifs:
   - Repeating triads or more complex structures
   - Characteristic connection patterns between certain types of nodes
   - Invariant relationships in different parts of the graph

4. Anomalies and special cases:
   - Unusual deviations from general patterns
   - Contradictory or paradoxical relationships
   - Isolated structures that do not correspond to the general picture

For each identified pattern, specify:
- Clear description of the pattern
- Where in the graph it manifests (specific nodes or subgraphs)
- Possible interpretation in the domain context
- How universal the pattern is for this graph (local or global)

Focus on meaningful and non-obvious patterns, not trivial ones.
Present the result in a structured format with sections for each type of pattern.

For each segment below, create a contextual summarization.

Segment: {{segment_text}}
ID: {{segment_id}}
Parent context: {{parent_context}}

For each segment, create:

1. A short, descriptive title (3-5 words) that captures the main topic of this segment
2. Brief summary (1-2 sentences)
3. Key points (3-5 bullets)
4. Role in document structure (e.g., "introduction", "argument", "example", "conclusion")
5. Relation to parent context (how this segment develops or illustrates higher-level ideas)

Present the result in JSON format with fields: id, title, summary, key_points, role, parent_relation.

Respond with a JSON object that strictly follows this schema:

Analyze the connections between the following text segments:

Segment 1: {{segment1_text}}
Segment ID: {{segment1_id}}

Segment 2: {{segment2_text}}
Segment ID: {{segment2_id}}

Determine:

1. Presence of meaningful connection (yes/no)
2. Connection type:
   - Cause-effect
   - Argument-counterargument
   - Common theme
   - Example-illustration
   - Thought development
   - Contrast
   - Other (specify)
3. Connection strength (0-1, where 1 is very strong)
4. Direction (one-way/bidirectional)
5. Key words or phrases indicating the connection

Present the result in JSON format with fields: segment1_id, segment2_id, has_connection, connection_type, strength, direction, key_indicators.

Respond with a JSON object that strictly follows this schema:

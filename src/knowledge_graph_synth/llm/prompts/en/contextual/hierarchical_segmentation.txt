Divide the following text into hierarchically organized segments.

Text: {{text}}

Create a structure with the following levels:
1. Main sections (if any)
2. Subsections (if any)
3. Logical blocks within subsections
4. Individual paragraphs or groups of related sentences

For each segment, specify:
- Unique ID (e.g., "1.2.3" for the 3rd block of the 2nd subsection of the 1st section)
- Original text
- Position in document (start-end in characters)

Present the result in JSON format with a nested structure reflecting the hierarchy.

Respond with a JSON object that strictly follows this schema:

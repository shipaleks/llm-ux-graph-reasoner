Analyze the following node clusters in the knowledge graph and determine which ones are suitable for abstraction into meta-concepts.

Node clusters:
{{clusters}}

For each cluster, evaluate:

1. Semantic coherence (0-10):
   - How meaningfully the nodes are actually connected
   - Whether there is a common theme or principle uniting the nodes
   - How much the nodes belong to the same level of abstraction

2. Structural integrity (0-10):
   - How isolated the cluster is from other clusters
   - How densely connected the nodes are within the cluster
   - Presence of a central node or group of nodes

3. Abstraction potential (0-10):
   - Possibility to formulate a unified meta-concept
   - Usefulness of abstraction for understanding the domain
   - Possibility to simplify the graph without losing essential information

4. Proposed meta-concept name:
   - Short but informative name
   - Reflecting the essence of the unified concepts
   - Corresponding to domain terminology

For clusters with a total score (sum of all assessments) above 20, suggest a brief definition of the meta-concept and the main attributes it should retain.

Present the result in a structured format with sections for each cluster.

Based on the following cluster of nodes from the knowledge graph, formulate a meta-concept that unifies and abstracts these nodes.

Cluster: {{cluster_name}}
Cluster nodes:
{{nodes}}

Internal connections:
{{internal_connections}}

External connections:
{{external_connections}}

Formulate:

1. Meta-concept name:
   - Precise and informative
   - Reflecting the essence of the unified concepts
   - In accordance with domain terminology

2. Meta-concept definition:
   - Clear and concise definition (1-2 sentences)
   - Covering all key aspects of the included nodes
   - At the right level of abstraction

3. Key attributes:
   - Common attributes preserved from the original nodes
   - New attributes emerging at the meta-concept level
   - Variable attributes reflecting the diversity of included nodes

4. Internal structure:
   - How the included nodes relate to each other within the meta-concept
   - What subcategories can be identified
   - What hierarchy or typology can be applied

5. Relationships with other concepts:
   - How the meta-concept relates to other parts of the graph
   - What types of relationships are preserved at the meta-level
   - What new types of relationships emerge

Ensure a balance between abstraction (to unify diverse elements) and concreteness (to preserve essential information).

            STEP 1: EVIDENCE GATHERING
            - Identify all relevant information from the text about {entity.name}
            - Note direct statements and implied information
            - Consider references, actions, dialog, and descriptions
            
            STEP 2: INFERENCE AND ANALYSIS
            - Connect pieces of evidence to form a coherent picture
            - Consider motivations, hidden meanings, and subtext
            - Identify gaps in information and make reasonable inferences
            - Think about what is NOT stated but can be reasonably inferred
            
            STEP 3: HYPOTHESIS FORMATION
            - Form a detailed hypothesis that answers the question
            - Consider alternative explanations and their likelihood
            - Evaluate the strength of your hypothesis based on available evidence
            
            STEP 4: ANSWER SYNTHESIS
            - Provide a comprehensive answer to the question
            - Include direct evidence and justified inferences
            - Clearly distinguish between what is explicitly stated and what is inferred
            - Rate your confidence in the answer (0-1 scale)
            
            STEP 5: NEW KNOWLEDGE EXTRACTION
            - List new entities discovered through this reasoning
            - List new relationships between entities
            - Identify new attributes or properties of existing entities

## Usage Instructions

1. **Installation**
   ```bash
   cd knowledge_graph_synth
   poetry install
   ```

2. **List Available Providers**
   ```bash
   poetry run kgs providers
   ```

3. **Process a Text File (Basic)**
   ```bash
   poetry run kgs process --file path/to/file.txt --extract --build-graph --generate-theories
   ```

4. **Process with Advanced Features**
   ```bash
   # Recursive expansion
   poetry run kgs process --file path/to/file.txt --extract --build-graph --expand-graph --generate-theories
   
   # Meta-graph creation
   poetry run kgs process --file path/to/file.txt --extract --build-graph --build-metagraph --generate-theories
   
   # Full analysis
   poetry run kgs process --file path/to/file.txt --extract --build-graph --expand-graph --build-metagraph --generate-theories
   ```

5. **Process Large Files**
   ```bash
   # Using gradual mode
   poetry run kgs process --file path/to/large_file.txt --extract --build-graph --generate-theories --gradual
   
   # Using helper script with optimized settings
   ./.scripts/analyze_large_file.sh path/to/large_file.txt
   ```

6. **Configure API Keys**
   - Edit the `.env` file with your API keys
   ```
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
   ```

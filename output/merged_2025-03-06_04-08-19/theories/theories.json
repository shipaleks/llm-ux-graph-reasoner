    "summary": "This theory posits that AI, particularly neural networks, is increasingly being used to enhance or replace traditional search and information retrieval methods, leading to both improvements and potential challenges in accessing and processing information.",
    "description": "The knowledge graph reveals a pattern where AI technologies, specifically neural networks, are being applied to various aspects of information access and product functionality. This includes enhancing existing products like search engines and potentially replacing them with AI-powered alternatives. The theory suggests a shift towards AI-driven solutions for information retrieval and processing, but also acknowledges potential issues like confusion arising from the interaction of multiple AI systems. This transformation impacts how users access knowledge, interact with products, and navigate complex information landscapes.",

    "title": "The Fragmentation of Information Access: From Centralized Search to Specialized Ecosystems",
    "summary": "This theory suggests that information access is becoming increasingly fragmented, moving away from centralized search engines towards specialized ecosystems and AI-driven tools that cater to specific needs and contexts, potentially creating silos and requiring users to navigate a more complex landscape.",
    "description": "The traditional model of a single search engine providing access to a broad range of information is being challenged by the rise of specialized platforms and AI-powered tools. This fragmentation is driven by several factors: the increasing complexity of information, the demand for personalized experiences, and the emergence of new technologies like neural networks. Instead of relying solely on a general search engine like 'поиск Яндекса', users are turning to specialized tools like 'чат с Алисой' for specific tasks or accessing information within closed ecosystems like 'Сберовской экосистемы'. This shift creates a more fragmented information landscape, where users must navigate multiple platforms and tools to satisfy their information needs. The 'AI-Driven Product Enhancement and Replacement' pattern contributes to this fragmentation by introducing AI-powered alternatives to traditional search, such as 'Алисы' replacing 'поисковика'. The 'Knowledge Access and Legal Information Retrieval' pattern highlights the need for specialized tools like 'консультант плюс' to access specific types of information, further reinforcing the trend towards fragmentation. The 'Product Ecosystem and Feature Interdependence' pattern demonstrates how information access is increasingly tied to specific product ecosystems, limiting the scope of search and encouraging users to stay within those ecosystems.",

Key individuals outside the family are drawn into this web through professional and personal connections, leading to an investigation.\n\nThis theory is based on the analysis of the document and the relationships identified within it.\n\nKey evidence supporting this theory:\n- Gregory disapproves of Jacob Price.\n- Amelia Cole investigates the Blythe family.\n- Dr. Tobias Sinclair is an informant for Amelia.\n- Prudence Hartwell has feelings for Gregory and works for the Blythe family.\n- Simon Bellows witnessed Jacob.\n\nKey entities involved:\n- Gregory: Central figure of the Blythe family, likely patriarch and owner of the shipping empire. His disapproval of Jacob Price suggests a potential conflict.\n- Amelia Cole: Investigative journalist seeking information about the Blythe family.  She is the driving force behind uncovering the secrets.\n- Dr. Tobias Sinclair: Family physician to the Blythes and informant for Amelia. He represents a conflict of interest and a source of crucial information.\n- Prudence Hartwell: Works for the Blythe family and has feelings for Gregory.  She is a potential witness and a source of internal information.\n- Jacob Price: A figure of disapproval by Gregory, suggesting a potential antagonist or rival. He is also witnessed by Simon Bellows.\n\nThe theory proposes to view the presented information as an interconnected structure,\nwhere each element plays a role in the overall picture.

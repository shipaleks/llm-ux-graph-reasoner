    "type": "relational",
    "subtype": "semantic",
    "description": "The absence of relationships in the knowledge graph, despite the presence of different entity types, indicates a lack of explicit connections or context between the entities. This could be due to the limited scope of the graph or a deliberate choice to focus on individual entities rather than their interactions.",
    "examples": [
      {
        "text": "No relationships exist between Яндекс, Яндекс Музыка, Яндекс Пэй, and нейро.",

    "confidence": 0.95,
    "significance": "The absence of relationships limits the insights that can be derived from the graph. It prevents the identification of dependencies, causal links, or other meaningful connections between the entities. This suggests that the graph is either incomplete or designed for a specific purpose that does not require relational information."

# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Product Overview

**KnowledgeGraphSynth** is a system that constructs, refines, and analyzes knowledge graphs from textual data to generate insights, theories, and structured knowledge. The system transforms unstructured text into a structured representation of concepts and their relationships, enabling deeper understanding and novel insights, while maintaining strict grounding in the original text.

## Target Users

- Researchers analyzing scientific literature
- Students synthesizing academic material
- Content analysts studying interviews or focus groups
- Literary scholars analyzing texts
- Legal professionals examining case documents

## User Problems

1. **Information Overload**: Users struggle to synthesize large volumes of text.
2. **Hidden Connections**: Important relationships between concepts are often missed.
3. **Structure Discovery**: It's difficult to identify the underlying structure of knowledge domains.
4. **Theory Generation**: Forming coherent theories from disparate textual sources is challenging.
5. **Cross-language Analysis**: Analyzing content in multiple languages requires significant effort.
6. **Hallucinations and Reliability**: AI-generated analyses often include information not present in the source.

## Key Features

### 1. Text Processing and Segmentation
- Process multiple text formats (TXT initially)
- Segment text into manageable chunks
- Preserve context between segments
- Support for both English and Russian languages

### 2. Entity and Relationship Extraction
- Domain-aware extraction of entities
- Identification of relationships between entities
- Resolution of coreferences (same entity mentioned differently)
- Confidence scoring for extracted information
- Grounding all entities in source text passages

### 3. Knowledge Graph Construction
- Create initial graph from extracted entities and relationships
- Visualize graph structure
- Identify key nodes and relationships
- Analyze graph metrics and patterns
- Track provenance of all graph elements

### 4. Recursive Expansion
- Generate follow-up questions to explore knowledge gaps
- Process LLM responses to these questions
- Extract new concepts and relationships
- Integrate new knowledge into the existing graph
- Verify all additions against source text

### 5. Meta-graph and Abstraction
- Group related concepts into higher-level abstractions
- Create a meta-graph of abstract concepts
- Maintain bidirectional links between abstractions and concrete entities
- Enable multi-level navigation of knowledge
- Preserve evidence links for all abstractions

### 6. Theory and Hypothesis Formation
- Identify patterns in the knowledge graph
- Formulate theories explaining these patterns
- Generate testable hypotheses
- Evaluate hypotheses against existing data
- Link all theories to supporting evidence

### 7. Output Generation
- Produce structured reports tailored to the domain
- Create visualizations of the knowledge graph
- Provide actionable insights and recommendations
- Support different output formats based on user needs
- Include citations and evidence for all claims

### 8. Multi-LLM Support
- Integrate with multiple LLM providers, with primary focus on Gemini
- Allow switching between providers
- Compare results from different models
- Implement fallback mechanisms for provider failures
- Support specialized models for different reasoning tasks

### 9. Hallucination Mitigation
- Track data provenance for all extracted information
- Ground all entities and relationships in source text
- Validate generated theories against source evidence
- Provide citation links to specific source passages
- Implement consistency checks for all generated content

## Non-functional Requirements

### Performance
- Process medium-sized texts (up to ~100 pages) within reasonable time
- Support asynchronous processing for larger documents
- Implement caching to reduce redundant LLM API calls

### Usability
- Clear, simple interface for non-technical users
- Meaningful error messages
- Progress indicators for long-running operations
- Comprehensive documentation

### Security
- Secure handling of API keys via environment variables
- No storage of sensitive information
- Privacy-preserving processing options

### Extensibility
- Pluggable architecture for new LLM providers
- Extensible entity and relationship types
- Customizable report templates

### Reliability
- Robust error handling for LLM API failures
- Graceful degradation when optimal responses aren't available
- Verification steps throughout the pipeline
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

## Success Metrics

- Accuracy of extracted entities and relationships (compared to human annotation)
- Coherence and usefulness of generated theories
- Evidence grounding ratio (percentage of claims with direct evidence)
- Citation accuracy (verified references to source text)
- User satisfaction with insights and reports
- Processing time for various text volumes
- System stability and error rate

## Out of Scope

- Real-time processing of streaming text
- Integration with databases for permanent storage
- Web crawler functionality for collecting texts
- Training custom LLMs
- Multi-user collaboration features

## Future Enhancements

- Support for additional file formats (PDF, DOCX, etc.)
- Database integration for persistent storage
- Web interface for easier interaction
- Fine-tuning capabilities for domain-specific tasks
- Collaborative analysis features
- Advanced NLP techniques for improved entity recognition
